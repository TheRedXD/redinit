# RedInit
This is a software built for easy project initialization, to remove part of the hassle often associated with languages like C, C++, and others. The goal is to have various kinds of toolchains accessible, have it be extremely easy to initialize pretty much anything, and ensure every project that can be, is built to support cross-platform and cross-architecture compilation, to help developers from the start build their software cross-platform.

The software is currently in a very early stage, it is HIGHLY encouraged for you to add extra scripts, and improve upon the software overall by making a **Pull Request**!

RedInit was built by TheRed.SH, an open-source software group.
